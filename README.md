# Test application

###Timing(very conditionally)
1. When loaded, gets a list of users from the following url: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users - 2 hours
2. Displays some basic info of the users in an html table or whatever you want - 2 hours
3. Allows opening a detailed view for a user (modal window - one at a time is fine) - 1 hour
4. Add some basic css to make the table (and other elements) easy on the eyes - 1 hour

###instalation

You need to create a clone of the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bangwww/myTask
```
Then go to folder "app" and run local server:
```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server -p 8000
```
Go to the URL
```sh
localhost:8000
```
